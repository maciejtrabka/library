    Optional -we haven’t learned any techniques for actually storing our data anywhere, 
    so when the user refreshes the page all of their books will disappear! If you want, 
    you are capable of adding some persistence to this library app using one of the following techniques:

    localStorage (docs here) allows you to save data on the user’s computer. The downside here is that 
    the data is ONLY accessible on the computer that it was created on. Even so, it’s pretty handy! Set 
    up a function that saves the whole library array to localStorage every time a new book is created, and 
    another function that looks for that array in localStorage when your app is first loaded. (make sure your 
    app doesn’t crash if the array isn’t there!)
    Firebase (check it out!) is an online database that can be set up relatively easily, allowing you to save 
    your data to a server in the cloud! Teaching you how to use it is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but
     it is almost definitely within your skill set. If you’re interested, check out this video to see what 
     it’s all about.
